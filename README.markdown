### Original notes from Rob Wilkerson:

* This plugin is inspired by the various Rails plugins for handling attachments (e.g. `Attachment_fu`, `Paperclip`, etc.) and what I consider their limitations.
* Although I bastardized the crap out of it to meet my own context and standards, I borrowed heavily from [tute's Thumbnail Component for CakePHP](http://github.com/tute/Thumbnail-component-for-CakePHP/tree/f0aacea0b786df58df433cda535cf6c909508eb2).
